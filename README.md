# AptPostProcessor
All code to postprocess the .apt file generated by CAM codes including Solidworks CAM.  Includes useful tools for a 5 axis machine with an Heidenhain controller.

Including aligment and simple machine tools.

To generate the apt file in solidworks cam:
- Define machine 
- define post-processor by selecting the apt box. Go to the milling fle directory of Solidworks CAM and choose mill.

To generate the STL export in options:
1 -In the CAM definition of Machine reference frame  tic "create SW coordinate system".
2- In saving file as STL open options and Choose the coordinate system created in solidcam using the "create SW coordinate system"
3- Select the "Do not translate stl output data to positive space".

The %FN15RUN.A file has syntax:

datumx, datumy,datumz (relative to the pivot)
x_ref1 y_ref1 z_ref1
x_ref2 y_ref2 z_ref2
...
-999 -999 -999
ntool1 DL1 DR1
ntool2 DL2 DR2
...

To use the micro...
 - copy the opencv installation dir (after compilation)
	- in an administrator promp execute: setx -m OPenCV_DIR <the instalation directory>
Tool measurement from apt Ex:
INSERT/8MM CRB 2FL 20 LOC
CUTTER/8.,0,4.,0,0,0,40.
LOAD/TOOL,17
CUTTER / d, r [, e, f, a, b, h]
 where:  d = cutter diameter
         r = cutter radius
         e = radial corner offset
         f = axial corner offset
         a = tip angle
         b = flank angle
         h = cutter height
